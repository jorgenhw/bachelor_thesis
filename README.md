<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project
This repository contains all the notebooks and files necessarry to reproduce the results found in the paper _'A Deep Dive into Danish NLP'_.

The project consists of three phases: In the first phase, we test and compare four different topic modelling methods to find the one that produces the most human interpretable topics from a Danish Twitter dataset. In the second phase, we fine-tune 11 Danish language models on a multilabel classification task on the same Twitter dataset. In the last phase, we outline a new method for doing model error analysis on the subgroups made by the best topic model. 

### Structure of the readme file
This readme file will be structured according to the above outlined phases. Thus, **section 1** contains details on which topic models were compared and provides links to notebooks which will enable a replication of the results presented in the bachelor thesis. Similarly, **section 2** contains details on which models were trained along with links to individual notebooks containing the scripts used for fine-tuning. The last **section (3)** contains a reproducible R-markdown script outlining how the sub-group error analysis was performed.

## Requirements to reproduce results

* A machine with a GPU (we used Google Colab: a virtual notebook environment that executes code on virtual machines with GPU)
* Python 3.6 or higher
* An R-markdown capable IDE

## üîß Set up
1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/jorgenhw/bachelor_thesis
cd bachelor_thesis/topic_modelling
```

2. Open notebook of interest

Open the notebook with the name of the topic modelling method you want to examine e.g. ```LDA.ipynb``` either through your own IDE or through Google Colab (links are provided in the table below).

The below table outlines which notebooks contains which methods.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the experiment we conducted to compare the performance of four topic modelling methods - NMF, LDA, BERTopic, and TweeTopic - showed that BERTopic was the best performer, meaning it was able to create the most human interpretable subgroups in the data. This was demonstrated through the evaluation method of qualitative assessment.

## Content of each notebook
Each notebook consist of five steps

1. Initialization of GPU, installation of necesarry packages and setup of WANDB
2. Importing libraries, data, and the language model
3. Data preprocessing
4. Fine-tuning
5. Evaluation

## Conclusion
In this project, we have successfully finetuned 11 Danish language models to demonstrate how a more fine-grained sub group error analysis metric can reveal new insights into language models. Suggestions for further research can be found in the paper _'A Deep Dive Into Danish NLP'_ (link provided in the top of this readme).

This project is part of a bachelor thesis in Cognitive Science at Aarhus University, Denmark, 2023.

2. Open markdown file 

## Content of markdown file

## Conclusion
In this markdown file we demonstrate how to conduct a subgroup error analysis on the performance of the fine-tuned models (section 2) in the the topics made by BERTopic in  section 1.

Instead of arriving at the trivial conclusion that larger models also have the highest accuracy in the sub-groups, we instead calculate the difference between each sub-group accuracy and the overall accuracy of a given language model. This is done through leave-one-group-out mean calculation to reduce the data-leakage between accuracy scores, since we are interested in the difference between a sub-group and all other groups that are not that sub-group. We call the resulting values a Relative Topic Accuracy Correction (RTAC).

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Google Colab and Hugging Face for their invaluable contributions to the field of machine learning and natural language processing.

Google Colab has provided us with a powerful platform for conducting research and development, allowing us to access state-of-the-art resources and technologies without the need for expensive hardware or software. Its intuitive interface and seamless integration with Google Drive have made it an essential tool for collaborating together and sharing our findings.

Hugging Face, on the other hand, has revolutionized the way we work with transformer-based models, providing us with a vast library of pre-trained models and a user-friendly API that allows us to easily fine-tune and deploy them for various tasks. Its commitment to open source and constantly updating its offerings have made it a go-to resource for researchers and practitioners alike.
